A tiny repository to practice using Git and GitHub. This workspace contains a few small example commits you can use to learn branching, committing, and creating pull requests.

Getting started

1. Check the repo status:

	git status

2. Create a branch and make a change:

	git checkout -b feature/update-readme
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "Improve README with usage and contribution steps"

3. Push the branch and open a pull request on GitHub:

	git push -u origin feature/update-readme

Contributing
